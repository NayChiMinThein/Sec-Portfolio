# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

This is my second portfolio, revamped and reinvented with the power of React, Tailwind CSS, and a dash of Framer Motion magic. Expect a fully responsive experience that's as captivating as it is informative. Come explore my projects, skills. I'm ready for your feedback!
